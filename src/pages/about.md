## Introduction

Protection of the environment is a pressing issue. Environmental protection encompasses not only pollution but also sustainable development and conservation of natural resources and the ecosystem. Today, the necessity of environmental awareness and enforcement is more demanding and urgent than ever before. The importance of public awareness on environmental protection is acknowledged worldwide. The emergence of the Voluntary Nature Conservancy represents an organised response by a civic society, to create an environmentally sensitive society and to implement on-ground measures leading to the protection of the environment.

As a responsible NGO, we have been taking several steps to promote discussion and debate about environmental issues, outside the broad spheres of popular media and the educational system. We have been contributing significantly in spreading awareness on environment and undertaking research and environment development issues. We will be glad to incorporate the cordial support of the young enthusiasts and nature lovers in this endeavour to save and protect nature. To involve others to be a part of the change, Voluntary Nature Conservancy is organising “Duleep Matthai Nature Writing Award”, a nature essay writing competition.
